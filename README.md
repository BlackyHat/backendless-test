# My Wallet App 👔 🖥️

Task:
Using React, React Router, and Webpack write a simple client-side app that works like a primitive CMS (content management system).
The app, upon its start, downloads a JSON file from a well-known path. The JSON file contains a description of tabs that must be rendered in the app.
